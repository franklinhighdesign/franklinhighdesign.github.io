			<li>	Today I figured out that you could tag specific lines of text. I had also finished my Journal Page on the website. Coincidentally this helped me to understand how immensly easy it was to actually add another page to a website. Worki today ewas also annoying seeing as that the sun was in my eyes but that is unimportant and not the point, in circumstances relating to work today I had a minor error trying to make certain list items have a background on them and next class I will be looking into working on doing so correctly. Well I (at the end of class) figured it out, I do not know why at all but, I tried it after changing NOTHING and it worked </li>

			<li>	I have made the game level design and found out that music can be assigned to anything, currently I have a floor set-up and a music track almost done I have my Scene saved and I FINALLY have my journals in order. I found out that you can actually assign any audio clip to anything and take out the Doppler Effect on the audio to make a theme song for the entirety of the game such as assigning the music to the floor so you could find it better since it's just the one child element(addition).</li>

I also learned how to use an Animation Controller(AC), also I am learning how to use CSharp (CS) to make the character move, die and eventually shoot.</li>

		<h3>Digital Design 3/22/2016</h3>

			<li>Digital Design </li>
			<li>Objective:  Students will... </li>
			<li>Agenda: -fix all coding errors</li>
			<li>        -Get Animation transferring done</li>
			<li>        -</li>
			<li>        -SUMMARY</li>
			<li>	So I found out that the majority of my errors are typos but, the script itself might have some bugs. If it does, I will have to find another tutorial to move the character and make the camera a child element of the character and see how the animator would take that. The Raycast method for the camera is a good concept but with Unity having released a new update since this tutorial i might have to spend some time with a tutor to help out with my coding problems. It also seems to turn out that Sublime Text isn't exactly a great code writer to use for C# (CSharp). Today I did however find out how to use a camera as a child element of something to use it to follow that thing you are moving. </li>

			<li>        -Move around and see how the game works</li>
			<li>        -</li>
			<li>        -SUMMARY</li>
			<li>	Well the player moves, the camera follows, and the scene looks great. The animation is a little buggy when it comes to switching from idle to moving though. I think its because of the smoothness dynamic next class I am going to investigate further into the problem. </li>

			<li>        -Finish the animating glitch</li>
			<li>        -</li>
			<li>        -SUMMARY</li>
			<li>	I now have an enemey in the game, it was a difficult and annoying process most prodominately due to the animator making far less sense than it did before. I just figured it was because i was away from the system in a while so trying to ignore the frustration I powered through but the animating thing with the player just threw me a curveball so i was a little annoyed that I still couldn't work out the bug with the player moving from idle to moving script/animation. Even with the frustration I did finish the enemy Zombunny and it will follow the player and have the normal walking. </li>

		<h3>Digital Design 3/30/2016</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Digital Design </li>
			<li>Objective:  Students will... MAKE THE ANIMATION SWITCH BETWEEN MOVING A TRIGGER AND IT MAY FIX THE WEIRD GLITCH WHER IT TAKES A WHILE TO GET INTO THE WALKING ANIMATION (took as a note from previous class now it is an objective.)</li>
			<li>Agenda: - Phaser Activity</li>
			<li>        -fix animation.</li>
			<li>        -</li>
			<li>        -SUMMARY</li>
			<li>1. There is no difference to me, working with nothing you have no clue what to do, working with code already in you are left wondering what they did. The help tab did absolutely nothing at all and the system just does not make any sense. After using Unity it just seems to be useless and far more difficult to use based off of just jumping in. 
			2. I changed the Physics with the jumping on the player sprite and I made the platforms moveable, other than that i was trying to figure out how to make the world bigger or change the look of anything but, I had no clue what code it was even running off of.	
			3. I tried playing iot but it was boring so instead I coded in it, unfortunately I did not like that either because it didn't make much sense. //ACTUALLY THE SUMMARY NOW\\ I finally found out how to get the animation to work!!! I had modified the animation so it will IMMEDIATLY stop when I stop moving or start moving and switch into the correct animation so I stop without doing the weird moving while not moving. Best part, I figured it out on my own.

			<li>	So I watched the tutorial and now the gun will shoot and is fully operational but, i only have the one enemy so i dont exactly have much of a game as much as I have a stupid loading screen for a game maybe. I'm going to try anf make some enemies for the game and some spawners next by continuing with the tutorials. however at least the gun can hit an enemy and make the little puff when it hits an enemy.
