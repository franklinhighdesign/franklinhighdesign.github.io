				<h2>Biography</h2>
				<blockquote>" Uuuuuur Ahhhhhrrr Uhrrr Ahhhrrr Aaargh"<p>
							<span id = "sig">—Chewbacca</span></blockquote>
				
				<p>Chewbacca the Wookiee was a tall, furry alien from the planet Kashyyyk. Known as "Chewie" to his friends, Chewbacca was a brave warrior and skilled pilot during the Clone Wars and Galactic Civil War, as well as fiercely loyal to the Solo family.</p>
				<p>Wookiees are long-lived creatures; Chewbacca was born nearly 200 years before the Star Wars films. In his youth, Chewie was adventurous, exploring the dangerous depths of the forests on Kashyyyk.</p>
				<p>As an adult, Chewbacca fought in the Clone Wars under Yoda. When the Clone Troopers carried out Order 66, Chewbacca helped protect Yoda and lead him to safety. Yoda was one of the few Jedi to survive the slaughter, but he could not defeat Palpatine and prevent him from establishing his evil Galactic Empire.</p>			
				<p>The Empire was not kind to non-Humans; Wookiees, because of their strength, were soon enslaved as laborers. When Chewie helped some other Wookiee slaves escape, the Imperial officer in charge ordered a young Imperial Lieutenant, Han Solo, to kill him. Solo refused and was court-martialed as a result.</p>
				<p>His military career behind him, Han Solo returned to his former life of crime as a smuggler. Chewbacca owed him a life-debt, and so joined him as his partner and co-pilot of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie would later extend his life-debt to Han's wife, Leia, and their children. Flying around the galaxy with Han left Chewbacca little time for his own family back on Kashyyk, however: his wife Mallatobuck and his son Lumpawarrump.</p>
				<p>Han Solo and Chewbacca joined the Rebellion almost by accident. After accepting the simple job of flying Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker to Alderaan, they discovered an Imperial Death Star instead, and were thrown into a crazy plan to rescue Princess Leia. Han Solo pled his loyalty to the Rebellion, later becoming a general, and Chewbacca loyally followed him to victory.</p>
