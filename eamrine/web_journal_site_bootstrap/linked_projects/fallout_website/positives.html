		<p>Fallout 4 took a feature that was only slightly visited in the previous game, Fallout New Vegas, to a whole new level. Previously, guns had only a few mods and armor customization was naught. Now, players have the ability to modify all aspects of a gun, including the barrel, the stock, the scope, the receiver, and more. You can change the handle of a laser pistol and create a laser rifle. You can change the barrel of a sawed-off shotgun to a long barrel, and you can give a sniper rifle multiple types of scopes. Guns aren't the only thing you can modify, however. Armor has it's own special line of customizations as well. you can upgrade damage resistances or increase carrying capacity through pocket mods. All this is done through the raw materials found in the junk of the wasteland. Glass from a beer bottle could be used to craft a scope, or steel from a scrapped gun can improve your armor's effectiveness.</p>

		<h1 class="smallHeader">Perk System</h1>
		<p>This aspect of the game isn't a straight upgrade from previous titles, however it is still enjoyable. As all Fallout games have, this Fallout has perks that help you better perform certain aspects of the game. Examples include Rifleman, which increases your non-automatic rifle damage, Locksmith, which allows you to pick specific-difficulty locks, or Toughness, which simply increases your overall damage resistance. You'll come to find that your perks are very important, as the iconic set of skill points is no longer in game. All focus is placed on perks, as they affect all aspects of gameplay that they previously did and assume the role that skills used to play, such as determining weapon damage or how effective healing items are. One way they've become more important is because all perks now have multiple ranks, increasing their effective with each subsequent rank.</p>

		<h1 class="smallHeader">Power Armor</h1>
		<p>Power Armor in this game is tremendously fun. The way it's acquired and used is different from before, but the role it plays in allowing you to dominate a battle through superior protection stays just the same. In all other games, Power Armor was simply equipped in your inventory after finding it. Now, giant frames have to be found throughout the wasteland that you have to physically enter and charge with fusion cores. Also, you can now mix and match each piece, allowing you to have combinations such as a T-45 helmet, T-51 legs, and T-60 arms. Beyond which armor pieces you have, you can also mod the armor to receive special effects. Some examples include a jetpack for the torso, knuckle modifiers that cause enemies to bleed for the arms, or an enemy-highlighting visor for the helmet.</p>

		<h1 class="smallHeader">Combat</h1>
		<p>Fallout 4's combat is surprisingly fluid for a Fallout title. A little more emphasis has been placed on first-person shooter elements than in Fallout 3 or New Vegas, but it's done so well that I have no grievances. Of course, V.A.T.S, the Vault-tec Assisted Targeting System, is still here. It's almost exactly the same, but now instead of completely pausing the action, V.A.T.S. only slows down enemy movement, so you're pressed to make a quick decision in the heat of battle. What's great is that even though this is a tremendous assistance in combat, you can easily play the game and fight without it. Sometimes, you'll prefer not to use it. Guns feel great and are easily controllable. Sadly, melee weapons are almost obsolete if you play on anything harder than normal difficulty. The use of grenades has been vastly improved with a new hot-key system that allows you to select a grenade in your pip-boy and use it in combat with the press of a button. Additionally, a bash feature has been added that allows you to deal a quick melee strike with the butt of your gun to stagger opponents.</p>
