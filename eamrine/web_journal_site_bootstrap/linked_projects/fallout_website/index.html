		<p id="historyLesson" class="description">Fallout is a series of games set in the 22nd and 23rd centuries in a post-apolyptic United States of America. On October 23, 2077, the world was plunged into nuclear fire by the U.S, China, and other countries in conclusion to a war over increasingly scarce resources that began in 2052. This catastrophe is commonly reffered to as "The Great War." Most would have expected this to be the end of humanity, but it was only the start of a new and bloody chapter.
		<br>
		<br>
		The Fallout series has 7 games (8 if the mobile game Fallout Shelter is included), but only 6 are considered canon (Fallout Tactics is technically only semi-canon) so they are the only ones featured here. The first 3 games were Fallout, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics. They were released in 1997, 1998, and in 2001, respectively. These were all top-down, isometric games and were exclusive to PC. Fallout 1 and 2 featured turn-based combat, while Tactics strayed a little with an almost real-time combat called "continuous turn-based" by developers. Fallout 3 was the first [canon] Fallout to be playable on consoles, and was released in 2008. It considerably changed gameplay by switching to a first-person shooter/RPG hybrid. Next, Fallout New Vegas was released in 2010. Finally, we're at 2015. The much awaited date of the newest installment, Fallout 4.</p>
