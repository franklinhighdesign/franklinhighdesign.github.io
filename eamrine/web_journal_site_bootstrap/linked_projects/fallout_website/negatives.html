		<h1 class="smallHeader">Bugs</h1>
		<p>Fallout 4 has some bugs. That's a fact. Normally, a couple bugs isn't much of a problem, but some of the ones I've witnessed are just unacceptable. Twice I've witnessed my brother play on his PC and encounter an enemy that was literally undefeatable. This wasn't a scenario in which his character was too weak to handle the challenge, but one in which the enemy took zero damage from him and NPCs alike. Also, I've noticed some bugs regarding Power Armor as well. On several occasions, my brother and I have both found armor that displayed the model for one set of armor, but upon activating, the armor magically transformed into a different, weaker model. This is a hugely dissapointing event. Beyond this, one or two side quests are bugged, preventing you from being able to complete them and receive the XP or rewards associated with them.</p>

		<h1 class="smallHeader">Loading Screens</h1>
		<p>Loading screens are a fact of games. There is no way to avoid them. With that being said, Sometimes it feels like half of my experience is loading screens. They appear frequently and often take upwards of 40 seconds. I don't mean to complain about a mandatory aspect of a video game, but something needs to be done to improve this irritant.</p>

		<h1 class="smallHeader">Dialogue</h1>
		<p>I appreciate what Bethesda tried to do in reworking the dialogue system, but it can sometimes feel broken or uninteresting. In Fallout 3 and New Vegas, when talking to a character in the game, time would stop, you would focus in on their face, and while standing still would select dialogue responses from a list at the bottom of the screen. Your character was mute. In Fallout 4, dialogue was brought to life with a first for the Fallout games; a voiced protagonist. This wasn't the only change, however. Instead of numerous responses listed at the bottom, you now have only 4 responses tied to buttons on a console controller or the directional arrows on a keyboard. With a limited number of choices, these interactions force me to choose from 1 of 4 options when in situations where none of them appeal to me. They also have very general descriptions and sometimes leave me unsure of what my choice will bring. Beyond that, speaking sequences are intiated by proximity to the NPC and you will sometimes have to try several times to start a conversation.</p>
