(translated Huttese language)."<p>								<span id = "sig">—Jabba to Princess Lea Organa(in disguise)</span></blockquote>					<p>Jabba the Hutt is a crime lord in the Star Wars franchise, an enormously fat, blob-like creature of the Hutt species. Jabba can barely move around in an environment of humanoids and is defenseless on his own, instead relying on numerous henchmen and slaves to get what he wants. He enjoys torture of his enemies, and entertainment from slaves. In the battle between the Republic and the Separatists, and later the Rebellion and the Empire, the Hutts are neutral. However Jabba has Han Solo in frozen carbonite by Boba Fett as his personal "trophy", and refuses to listen to any bargain that the Rebels propose for him to bring about Solo's release, and he is eventually strangled to death by Leia Organa, who he had made into his personal slave, with the chains he bound her with. Jabba is consumed by flames when his ship explodes.</p>					<p>Jabba the Hutt made his first actual appearance in Return of the Jedi, which contains the main events described above and including his death, but was also mentioned frequently in The Empire Strikes Back and was actually created at the time of the first Star Wars movie, where his scene was deleted due to inadequate special effects and budget, but was later added back in for the remake. He also makes a cameo in Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, where he hosts the Podrace on Tatooine. And of course, Jabba the Hutt appears in countless works of the "Expanded Universe".</p>					<p>Jabba is best remembered by audiences for his disgusting appearance and enormous girth, which has been parodied numerous times and is commonly associated with obesity, even though in Jabba's case it is an inherent trait of his race.</p>				</div>			<div id = "images">				<div class = "smallImage" id = "imageOneJabba"><img src="photos/Jabbaone.png" alt="Jabba The Hut"></div>				<div class = "smallImage" id = "imageTwoJabba"><img src="photos/Jabbatwo.jpg" alt="Jabba The Hut"></div>				<div class = "smallImage" id = "imageThreeJabba"><img src="photos/Jabbathree.jpg" alt="Jabba The Hut"></div>			</div>		</div>		<div id = "footer">		</div>	</div>	</body></html>
