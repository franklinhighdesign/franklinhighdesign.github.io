			  	Hello and welcome to my daily journal and project showcase page. My name is Zachary McKean, I took coding one with Rob Jaimeson my first semester of my sophmore year, it went great and I ended up getting an A in the class. I expect to learn how to use bootstrap, to incorperate Javascript into some of the websites I've already coded, and continue to problem solve and learn from those expiriences. As for what I want to learn, I'd like to continue working with unity even if it is only for a little bit, other than that anything and everything! I like the fact that we are able to work at our own pace and excell if we choose to. I would prefer we do not work out of a textbook for this class and rather learn by trial and error similar to how we worked first semester.
