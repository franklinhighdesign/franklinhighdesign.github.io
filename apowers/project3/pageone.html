			<p class="contentTextOne"> Vermintide takes place in the Old World, during the End Times. The Orcs, Lizard Men, and Skaven are beginning to march against the Humans and Dwarves. During all of this the forces of Chaos are rallying the largest army they've ever had, and are preparing to end all things. It is just before all of this that Vermintide takes place. The Skaven have massed an underground army to invade the Empireof Man, starting with Ubersreik. Ubersriek is a medium sized human town on the edge of the Reikland. The Skaven are a race of rat men that have built their massive Under Empire beneath the ground of the Old World. Skaven are cruel and nearly endless. They are commanded by their malevolent god known as the Horned Rat. No longer content with scavenging below the ground, they are moving to take the Empire lands. The Empire of man is the greatest nation of the Old World. The people of the Empire are not held down by the limits of tradition like the Dwarfs or High Elves and continue to progress culturally, technologically and magically. It is the faith, the sense of righteousness, and the unconquerable spirit of its citizens which gives the Empire its strength, as well as the ruthless efficiency of its military and religious orders.</p>
