			<p class="contentTextOne"> Vermintide is a Warhammer Fantasy video game made by Fat Shark and Games Workshop. It's a first person cooperative action game where you and three other players fight through hoardes of Skaven to protect the city of Ubersriek. There are five playable classes, and nine types of enemies. Along the way players can collect weapons, and tools based on random dice roles at the end of each mission.  </p>
			<p class="contentTextOne"> You start in the Red Mood Inn, which is run by Franz Lohner, a man who knows far more about what's going on than anyone else should. From the inn you can access the Ubersriek Map, which allows you to choose a mission, and what difficulty you want to play it on. You can also use the armory to view, and change your weapons and trinkets. Each class has multiple kinds of weapons, both melee and ranged, and trinkets that give you passive bonuses. Lastly there is the Forge. The forge can let you do three things: enchant, recycle, reforge weapons. Recycling weapons destroys them and gives you either a common, uncommon, or rare materials. You then use these materials to enchant weapons which unlocks special abilites.
