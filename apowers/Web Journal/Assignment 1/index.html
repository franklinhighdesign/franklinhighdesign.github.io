		<p class="maintext"> Ymir is what's known in smite as a support. He assists another player that is less powerful early in the game, but can become more powerful later. Many players also use this god to deal immense amounts of damage if the person they would be supporting can handle the lane by their self. In Norse Mythology Ymir was a primeval being made of elemental venom. The gods Odin, Vili, and Ve, killed him and used his body to make the Earth. His blood became the sea, from his bones the hills, from his skull the heavens, from his hair the trees, from his brains the clouds, and from his eyebrows the middle realm known as Midgard, which is where the humans live. In Smite, Ymir is a powerful guardian, with incredibly high potential damage. </p>

Enemies in the radius are slowed until it detonates, and when it does, it does a considerable amount of damage. It can be detonated early by canceling it, but it will do less damage. </p> </li>
